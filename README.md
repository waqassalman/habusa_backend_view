## ⚙️ What is this

`habusa_backend_view` is the backend service for the “Habusa” project — a web application backend built with Node.js / Express (or whichever backend tech you used) — designed to provide API endpoints, data handling, and business-logic for the frontend client.  

This backend handles user authentication, data storage/retrieval, and serves as the main API for application features (e.g. user management, content/data operations, etc.)
